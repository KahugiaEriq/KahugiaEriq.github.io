Skilled in Level 2/3 incident resolution, change management, disaster recovery, and application integrations supporting financial and enterprise systems. Proven ability in front-end and back-end technologies (React, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and MongoDB) and collaborating cross-functionally to meet stringent security and regulatory requirements.
